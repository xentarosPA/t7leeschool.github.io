## Useful HMS transitions

<details>
<summary markdown="0">b+4,3</summary>

- With the HMS cancel, b+4 becomes -2~-0 on block, +8~+10 on hit along with the properties of b+4
- The best keepout tool that Lee has. Larger than normal vertical hitbox and a forward range is generous.
  - Notorious tracking to both sides if the 3 is delayed (effectively a b+4>3), to the extent that it is now called as 'pseudo-homing' because it almost acts as a homing move.
  - The HMS cancel puts Lee far back from the hitbox which makes whiff punishing this move harder for the opponent.
  - HMS 2 follow up goes under most highs with a restricted vertical hitbox e.g. Jabs.
  - HMS 3 powercrush follow up catches anything slower than a jab. i10 moves (like jabs) will get consumed by the power crush and allow the opponent to duck under HMS 3.
  - Use as a keepout tool mainly. However, it can be used to imply a frame data mind game on block at close range.
  - On counter hit, pickup with HMS~f, ws 2,3 into the rest of the staple combo.
- Cancelling into stand guard from b+4,3 should be practiced by inputting d,db,b (quarter circle back motion) during the recovery of b+4,3 i.e. as soon as Lee lands his right foot on the ground. Cancelling saves you from being locked in HMS, and saves you from unwarranted whiff punishes from the opponent.
  - The cancel into stand guard can be limited to only d,db to enter FC directly from HMS and imply a FC mixup if needed.
- Moves out of the HMS can be used to consume the opponent's tries to whiff punish your out-of-range b4 whiffs.
- Should not be abused against characters with long range whiff punishment.

<summary markdown="0">f,f,F+3,4,3</summary>

- +6 on block, KND on hit
- Lee's running move that gives free plus frames with second hit, floor break with second hit, wall break with first hit.
- Use it to close distances from range 1+ and gain plus frames on the side.
  - Doing the f,f,F motion does telegraph your f,f,F+3,4,3 attempt if done from afar
  - Opponents can side step this move easily on reaction to your telegraph.
  - Practice instant while running motion to force proper use.
- Ends in HMS and on block provides an uninterruptible HMS 1+2 attempt if done as soon as HMS transition recovers.
  - Lili and Alisa can side-step-left HMS 1+2.
- All moves slower than i15 are uninterruptible on block.
- On hit opponent goes in a backrollable spike animation
  - If the opponent does not backroll out of the spike (by not holding B), then Lee gets a free HMS uf+4 on-the-ground hit.
- Can be performed with usual instant while running motion techniques.
- Gives free combo on hit on floor-break stages starting with aerial hit 2 because the second hit breaks floors on aerial hit.
  - Use at wall splats/tailspins when near the wall to break the floor to get a high wallsplat combo after.

<summary markdown="0">ws3,3,4</summary>
- -15 on block and -4 on hit, causes Lee to sway back. 
- Assuming the opponent knows about the followups, challenging it is very rarely to occur when the move is on hit due to the punishability of ws33 (d33) (df33)
- Ws33 (4) hitman 3 gets beat out by ws4's, and wins against most i13 ws moves.
- Some followups that can be enforced are: Hitman 1+2, fcdf4, hitman 4, hitman 3, and there isn't really any reason to do hitman 1 4, but you can cancel to hitman 11f to continue standing pressure after punishment.
- One thing to worry about before enforcing your own mixups is to know your opponent's full crouch game and what they can do afterwards as a form of retaliation against you enforcing your mixup. May require a couple of checks on characters like Anna, Heihachi, Julia, or anyone with a meaty full crouch low.

<summary markdown="0">D+4,4,4,4,3</summary>
- Extremely risky move to do in neutral. Often used as a round ender.
- D4 by itself is a safe poke, however all of the followups on hit are launch punishable. 
- Every hit of the move is low parryable on hit/block.
  - D4 4 4 is also massively delayable, and the delay can hit people trying to fuzzy low parry the followup hits
- The 3 at the end will cause Lee to sway back, and will avoid punishes that don't have good reach, some hopkicks will not reach and some df2s will whiff completely.

## d/f+4

<!-- https://discordapp.com/channels/361852916203651074/459202763159633933/459203002427899924 -->

- Has big pushback. Useful to see how they handle playing at range.
- On block, d/f+4,3 1,f~N over and over
  - See if you catch a duck with it
  - If you do, then they either know that Sway 4 exists or they don't know how to deal with the range it leaves you at
  - You can MS 3,4 or f,F+3 them if they whiff
- It's like doing 3,4 HMS cancel over and over
- But better since you're creating a huge amount of space first, letting you MS in

## 1,2,f\~N

<!-- https://discordapp.com/channels/361852916203651074/362318093097107458/442468808750268417 -->

- Good way to know if your opp knows the Lee match up
- Most follow ups lose to SWL
- If the opp doesn't do that, you get fake pressure for free
